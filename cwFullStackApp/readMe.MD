Did tutorial in React native
Mapped Out basic component structure
Tried to familarise myself with firebase.
Got Stuck
Decided to use dummy data and get the main front end working/ looking ok
Imported navigation. Took forever
Once navigation was more or less done,
tried to get detail view working properly
Attempt to build back end

Add border to image
